# AbstR

This R Shiny web application generates random abstracts from fields you define, and helps the user swipe through AGU 2017 conference data. This app was inspired by PapR, a “tinder for academic preprints”.  

Data was obtained from the AGU Open API.  

I'm very grateful to Jeff Leek, Jeff Leek, Lucy D'Agostino McGowan, and Nick Strayer for their work on Paper, the app that inspired this creation. I'm also very appreciative for developers behind the awesome [`shinysense library`](https://github.com/nstrayer/shinysense) that brings incredible interactivity to shiny apps.
