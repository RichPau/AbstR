## Acknowledgments
I'm very grateful to Jeff Leek, Jeff Leek, Lucy D'Agostino McGowan, and Nick Strayer for their work on Paper, the app that inspired this creation. I'm also very appreciative for developers behind the awesome [`shinysense` library](https://github.com/nstrayer/shinysense) that brings incredible interactivity to shiny apps.
